**Let's write a modern Fortran tutorial. Show a "Hello World" Fortran program with a comment line and explain how to compile and run the program on Linux and Windows.**

Absolutely, here is a simple Fortran "Hello World" program:

```
! This is a simple Fortran program
program HelloWorld
    implicit none
    print*, 'Hello, World!'
end program HelloWorld
```

Let's break down this code:

* `! This is a simple Fortran program` is a comment line in Fortran. Any line starting with ! is considered a comment and is not processed by the compiler.
* `program HelloWorld` starts the definition of a program called HelloWorld.
* `implicit none` is a statement that tells the Fortran compiler to require explicit declaration of all variables. It's considered good practice to include this in all your Fortran programs to avoid possible problems with undeclared variables or misspelled variable names.
* `print*, 'Hello, World!'` is a statement that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
* `end program HelloWorld` ends the program definition.

Now, to compile and run this program:

**Linux:**
1. Save the program in a file named `helloworld.f90`.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `helloworld.f90` using the `cd` command.
4. Compile the program with the gfortran compiler like this:
```
gfortran -o helloworld helloworld.f90
```
Here, `gfortran` is the name of the compiler, `-o helloworld` specifies the output file name, and `helloworld.f90` is the source file.

5. If there are no errors in your program, the compiler will create an executable file named `helloworld`.
6. Run the program like this:
```
./helloworld
```
**Windows:**
1. Save the program in a file named `helloworld.f90`.
2. Open a command prompt window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `helloworld.f90` using the `cd` command.
4. Compile the program with the gfortran compiler like this:
```
gfortran -o helloworld.exe helloworld.f90
```
Here, `gfortran` is the name of the compiler, `-o helloworld.exe` specifies the output file name, and `helloworld.f90` is the source file.

5. If there are no errors in your program, the compiler will create an executable file named `helloworld.exe`.
6. Run the program like this:
```
helloworld.exe
```

7. Please note that this assumes you have the gfortran compiler installed on your system. If it is not installed, you need to download and install it. There are many tutorials available online for how to do this.
8. Furthermore, the process to compile and run the program can differ based on the development environment or the IDE you are using. For example, in some IDEs, you can compile and run the program with a single click.

**What will be the name of the executable if you compile with `gfortran helloworld.f90` on Linux and on Windows?**

When you compile a Fortran source file `helloworld.f90` with `gfortran helloworld.f90` on Linux, the resulting executable will be named `a.out` by default, as mentioned earlier.

On Windows, the default name of the executable generated by gfortran is `a.exe`. This is the default name used by gfortran for the compiled executable when an explicit output name is not provided.

If you want to specify a custom name for the executable on either Linux or Windows, you can use the `-o` option followed by the desired name, as shown in the previous response.

**Why is the suffix .f90 used? Is it mandatory?**

The `.f90` suffix is commonly used for Fortran source files that use the free form source code layout introduced with Fortran 90. This is the layout that allows for flexibility with white space and line breaks compared to the older fixed form layout, which was quite restrictive.

The suffix is not mandatory, but it is recommended for the following reasons:

It helps to identify the file type quickly. If you see a file with a `.f90` extension, you can immediately identify it as a Fortran 90 or later source code file.

Some Fortran compilers use the file extension to determine the source form to expect. For example, with the gfortran compiler, a `.f` or `.for` extension indicates fixed-form source, whereas `.f90`, `.f95`, `.f03`, `.f08` indicate free-form source.

So, while not mandatory, it is generally a good idea to use the `.f90` extension (or the appropriate extension for your Fortran version) for your Fortran source files.

---
**How can you tell a compiler to treat a source file with the .f extension as free form source?**

In Fortran, the `.f` file extension typically indicates a fixed-form source file. To instruct the compiler to treat a file with the `.f` extension as free-form source code, you can use compiler-specific flags or extensions.

For example, with the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran), you can use the `.f90` extension for free-form source code, and it will be automatically recognized as such. If you specifically want to treat a file with the `.f` extension as free-form, you can use the `-ffree-form` flag when compiling:
```
gfortran -ffree-form filename.f
```
Other Fortran compilers may have different flags or conventions for indicating free-form source code. It's recommended to consult the documentation or user guide of your specific compiler for the appropriate options.

Alternatively, you can consider renaming the file to have the `.f90` extension to ensure it is treated as free-form source code by default.

**How do I do arithmetic in Fortran with ordinary numbers, without defining any variables? What are the available operators?**

In Fortran, you can perform arithmetic operations without explicitly defining variables. You can directly use the values or literals in the arithmetic expressions. The available operators for arithmetic operations in Fortran with ordinary numbers are:

Addition: `+`

Subtraction: `-`

Multiplication: `*`

Division: `/`

Exponentiation: `**`

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of these operators without explicitly defining variables:
```
program arithmetic_example
    implicit none
    integer :: result
    
    result = 2 + 3    ! Addition
    print*, "2 + 3 =", result
    
    result = 5 - 2    ! Subtraction
    print*, "5 - 2 =", result
    
    result = 4 * 3    ! Multiplication
    print*, "4 * 3 =", result
    
    result = 10 / 3   ! Division
    print*, "10 / 3 =", result
    
    result = 2 ** 4   ! Exponentiation
    print*, "2 ** 4 =", result
end program arithmetic_example
```
The output of this program will be:
```
2 + 3 = 5
5 - 2 = 3
4 * 3 = 12
10 / 3 = 3
2 ** 4 = 16
```

**Tell me about variables.**

In Fortran, as in many other programming languages, variables are used to store data that your program can manipulate. Each variable in Fortran has a name, a type, and a value.

Here are the main types of variables in Fortran:

1. **Integer**: This is used to store integer values. For example:
    ```Fortran
    integer :: x
    x = 5
    ```

2. **Real**: This is used to store real numbers (i.e., floating point values). For example:
    ```Fortran
    real :: y
    y = 3.14
    ```

3. **Complex**: This is used to store complex numbers. A complex number has a real part and an imaginary part. For example:
    ```Fortran
    complex :: z
    z = (1.0, 2.0)  ! 1.0 is the real part and 2.0 is the imaginary part
    ```

4. **Logical**: This is used to store logical values, i.e., `.true.` or `.false.`. For example:
    ```Fortran
    logical :: is_true
    is_true = .true.
    ```

5. **Character**: This is used to store characters or strings. For example:
    ```Fortran
    character(len=5) :: s
    s = "Hello"
    ```

Variable names in Fortran must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. The Fortran language is case insensitive, meaning that `myVariable`, `MYVARIABLE`, and `MyVariable` would all refer to the same variable.

Before using a variable in Fortran, it must be declared in a type declaration statement (as shown in the examples above). The `::` symbol is used to separate the variable type from the variable name(s) in the declaration. You can declare multiple variables of the same type on the same line by separating the names with commas, like so: `integer :: x, y, z`.

The `implicit none` statement is commonly used in Fortran programs to require that all variables be explicitly declared. If you don't include this statement, Fortran will implicitly declare variables according to rules based on the first letter of the variable name, which can sometimes lead to confusing bugs if you make a typo in a variable name.

You can also specify the precision of `real` and `complex` variables when you declare them. For example, `real(kind=8) :: x` declares `x` as a double-precision real variable. (**Note:** That is not guaranteed to work with all compilers. It is better to write define a kind parameter with something like `integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)` and then write `real(kind=dp)`). The `kind` parameter determines the precision and range of the variable.

**What is a "double-precision" real variable?**

A "double-precision" real variable in Fortran is a type of floating-point variable that offers greater precision (i.e., more significant digits) and a wider range than "single-precision" real variables. The term "double-precision" comes from these variables utilizing twice the number of bits as single-precision variables.

In terms of bits, a single-precision real number usually uses 32 bits, while a double-precision real number uses 64 bits. The exact specifics can vary by system and compiler, but in general:

- Single-precision real variables can typically provide up to 7 decimal digits of precision, with a range of about 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38.
- Double-precision real variables can provide up to 15 decimal digits of precision, with a range of about 2.2E-308 to 1.8E+308.

In Fortran, you can declare a double-precision variable with a statement like this:

```Fortran
double precision :: x
```

Or, you can use the `kind` specifier with the `real` type to declare a variable of a specific kind (precision). For instance, `kind=8` is commonly used for double-precision:

```Fortran
real(kind=8) :: x
```

(**Note:** see the comment above warning against declarations such as `real(kind=8)`). Remember that using more precise variables consumes more memory, so it's a good idea to use the level of precision that's appropriate for your needs.

**How do you display the values of variables you have set?**

You can display the values of variables in Fortran using the `print` or `write` statements.

Here's a simple example that demonstrates this with an integer, a real, a logical, and a character variable:

```Fortran
program DisplayValues
    implicit none
    integer :: x
    real :: y
    logical :: is_true
    character(len=10) :: s

    x = 5
    y = 3.14
    is_true = .true.
    s = "Hello"

    print*, 'The value of x is: ', x
    print*, 'The value of y is: ', y
    print*, 'The value of is_true is: ', is_true
    print*, 'The value of s is: ', s
end program DisplayValues
```

In this program, the `print` statement is used to display the values of the variables. The `*` in the `print` statement is a placeholder for the output format - in this case, we're using the default format. Following the `,` you can list any number of variables or strings to print. The variables and strings will be printed in the order you list them.

You could run this program, and it would display the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `is_true`, and `s`.

Also, please note that Fortran will print logical variables as `T` for `.true.` and `F` for `.false.`.

**What are the values of variables before they are set?**

In Fortran, as in many other programming languages, variables that are declared but not initialized can contain "garbage" values -- whatever data happened to be in the memory location assigned to the variable.

For example, consider the following Fortran code:

```Fortran
program UninitializedVar
    implicit none
    integer :: x
    print*, 'The value of x is: ', x
end program UninitializedVar
```

If you run this program, it may print out a random number as the value of `x`, or it might cause a runtime error, depending on the compiler and runtime environment. The value of `x` before it's initialized is unpredictable, so you should always initialize your variables before you use them.

Fortran provides a convenient way to declare and initialize a variable in one line. Here's an example:

```Fortran
program InitializedVar
    implicit none
    integer :: x = 10
    print*, 'The value of x is: ', x
end program InitializedVar
```

In this program, `x` is declared as an integer and initialized to `10`. If you run this program, it will consistently print `The value of x is:  10`, because `x` is initialized before it's used.
