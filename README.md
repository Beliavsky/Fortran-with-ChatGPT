Questions about Fortran answered by ChatGPT

**Let's write a modern Fortran tutorial. Show a "Hello World" Fortran program with a comment line and explain how to compile and run the program on Linux and Windows.**

Absolutely, here is a simple Fortran "Hello World" program:

```
! This is a simple Fortran program
program HelloWorld
    implicit none
    print*, 'Hello, World!'
end program HelloWorld
```

Let's break down this code:

* `! This is a simple Fortran program` is a comment line in Fortran. Any line starting with ! is considered a comment and is not processed by the compiler.
* `program HelloWorld` starts the definition of a program called HelloWorld.
* `implicit none` is a statement that tells the Fortran compiler to require explicit declaration of all variables. It's considered good practice to include this in all your Fortran programs to avoid possible problems with undeclared variables or misspelled variable names.
* `print*, 'Hello, World!'` is a statement that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
* `end program HelloWorld` ends the program definition.

Now, to compile and run this program:

**Linux:**
1. Save the program in a file named `helloworld.f90`.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `helloworld.f90` using the `cd` command.
4. Compile the program with the gfortran compiler like this:
```
gfortran -o helloworld helloworld.f90
```
Here, `gfortran` is the name of the compiler, `-o helloworld` specifies the output file name, and `helloworld.f90` is the source file.

5. If there are no errors in your program, the compiler will create an executable file named `helloworld`.
6. Run the program like this:
```
./helloworld
```
**Windows:**
1. Save the program in a file named `helloworld.f90`.
2. Open a command prompt window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `helloworld.f90` using the `cd` command.
4. Compile the program with the gfortran compiler like this:
```
gfortran -o helloworld.exe helloworld.f90
```
Here, `gfortran` is the name of the compiler, `-o helloworld.exe` specifies the output file name, and `helloworld.f90` is the source file.

5. If there are no errors in your program, the compiler will create an executable file named `helloworld.exe`.
6. Run the program like this:
```
helloworld.exe
```

7. Please note that this assumes you have the gfortran compiler installed on your system. If it is not installed, you need to download and install it. There are many tutorials available online for how to do this.
8. Furthermore, the process to compile and run the program can differ based on the development environment or the IDE you are using. For example, in some IDEs, you can compile and run the program with a single click.
